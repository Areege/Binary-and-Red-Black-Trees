# Binary and Red Black Trees
This Java program creates classes for structuring both a Binary Search Tree and a Red Black Tree. Methods allow for the user to insert a node into the tree, print out a search path for a value the user enters, and retrieve the value of the total depth of the tree. There is also a file that tests to make sure that everything is working correctly.

This program was created in April of 2017.
